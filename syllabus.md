# IMPORTANT NOTICES


## 1. HEALTH AND WELLNESS

-   Covid-19 and other respiratory viruses are continuing to evolve and
    infection and hospitalization rates continue to show depressing
    cycles of surge and fall, at both a local and national level&#x2013;long
    beyond what was hoped almost five years ago!

-   To reduce the risk of infection and increase the possibility of
    wellness allowing us to focus on learning and working together,
    please be monitor your health and be mindful of others around
    you. You are always welcome to wear a mask in class for whatever
    reason and the professor will frequently do so.

-   This is a request for us to think socially about how our choices
    impact others and how we can maximize learning opportunities.
    **Please respect each other's choices on this issue**.


## 2. ATTENDANCE, ZOOM AND CLASS RECORDINGS

-   **ZOOM AND CLASS ATTENDANCE WHEN UNWELL** - If you feel sick or are
    showing symptoms of flu, cold, or Covid-19 then **PLEASE BE
    CONSIDERATE** of your classmates and attend the class remotely
    through Zoom. All class sessions will be available live through Zoom
    (see links in Canvas) and as recordings.

-   Please make use of ****absence notices**** in `Path@Penn` to inform the
    professor if you need to miss class due to extenuating
    circumstances. Submitting an absence notice does not excuse students
    from their course obligations. But you can view missed class session
    in class recordings in Canvas.

# Course Description, Goals and Objectives

-   This course is a general overview of the important components of
    social research, primarily through the use of quantitative methods
    but it also considers qualitative and mixed-methods
    approaches. It covers defining research problems, research design,
    assessing research quality, sampling, measurement, and the use of
    statistical methods.

-   Course activities will include class exercises, reading and
    analyzing published scientific articles, using statistical software
    (R), and discussing research featured in the news.

-   **NOTE**: Much of the lecture material will be posted in videos and
    readings on Canvas so that we can maximize in class activities and
    discussion. You will be expected to have done the readings and
    watched this material **BEFORE** the first class of the week (See
    schedule for details).

-   Most weeks one session will focus more on the current topic and
    review and discuss the readings and previously posted lecture and
    provide background for the theory and methods. The second will be
    a lab session in which students will work through exercises using
    the R programming language (we will use a web-based data analysis
    and programming environment called JuypterHub to do this).


## Goals and objectives

-   By completing this course students will:
    -   understand the logic behind social science research applied to
        Communication
    -   be able to view research with a critical eye
    -   have hands-on experience of some of the key methods used in
        Communication research
    -   gain a basic level of programming proficiency in the R programming
        language and have completed a number of programming exercises to
        clean, analyze, visualize and interpret data
    -   understand and have practiced the use of basic descriptive and
        inferential statistical methods


# Assessment

-   Quizzes (20%)
    -   Most weeks there will be a short quiz related to the lecture and
        readings for the week. The quiz will be available in Canvas and
        should be completed **BEFORE** the first class of the week.

-   Lab Assignments (35%)
    -   Weekly lab sessions will focus on learning to use R for data and
        statistical analysis and will include questions to complete and
        submit by Sunday 11.59pm the same week.

-   Two small group mini projects (45%)
    -   These projects will give you a chance gain hands-on experience using
        some of Communication research methods we will cover in the
        lectures and readings.
        1.  Interviews (Qualitative) and Survey measure (Quantitative) (20%)
        2.  Content Analysis (Quantitative) and Discourse Analysis (Qualitative) (25%)

-   More details will be provided as the course progresses.


# Textbooks and recommended readings


## Textbooks

1.  Scharrer, E. and Ramasubramanian, S. (2021) *Quantitative Research
    Methods in Communication: The Power of Numbers for Social Justice*.
    Routledge (Available online through the library)
    -   There will be weekly readings from this book aligned with the
        topics for the lectures. The quizzes will be primarily based on the
        content of these readings.
    -   This book is referenced as **S&R** in the schedule below.

2.  Wickham, H. and Grolemund. G. (2017) *R for Data Science*. O'Reilly
    Media. (Available online: <https://r4ds.had.co.nz/index.html>)
    -   We will use parts of this book in the lab sessions for learning to
        use R. The book focuses on using `ggplot` for visualization and the
        `tidyverse` libraries for data analysis, just as we will.
    -   There is more advanced material in the book that we won't be able
        to cover but it is well worth spending some time trying some of the
        exercises throughout the chapters.
    -   This book is referenced as **W&G** in the schedule below.

# Note about learning programming

One of the aims of this class is to help students begin to develop data
analysis and programming skills that they can use as a part of carrying
out research. But like learning any new skill, such as a new spoken
language, it takes time and can be frustrating at first. This course
does not require students to have any programming background.
Realistically it is not possible to become a fully proficient programmer
in just one semester. However, the lab sessions and assignments are
focused on helping you begin this process and to become comfortable with
reading, understanding and modifying R code examples that you can find
on the web etc.
